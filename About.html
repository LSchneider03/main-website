        <p>At Small World Cupcakes, we bake authentic, old-world bakery products from recipes handed down from generation to generation. We do not use shortcuts in the baking process, and all our baked goods are made by hand from ingredients brought directly from a small town in Germany known as Maiglocken, which means "Lily of the Valley." The lily has been added to our logo as a tribute to these quality ingredients. At Small World Cupcakes, we bake only the best, and we are proud to do so!
